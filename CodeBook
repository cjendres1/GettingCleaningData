This CodeBook describes the variables in the tidy data set created with program runAnalysis.R
that is located in this repository.

Feature Selection 
=================

-NOTE - the following paragraphs are direct from the original data source and describe
the original variables and data collection. Variables have been renamed slightly and
reflect the names as appear in the tidy data set.

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and  
gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. 
These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. 
Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with 
a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated 
into body and gravity acceleration signals (tbodyacc_{XYZ} and tgravityacc_{XYZ} using another low pass 
Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals 
(tbodyaccjerk_{XYZ} and tbodygyrojerk_{XYZ}. Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated 
using the Euclidean norm (tbodyaccmag, tgravityaccmag, tbodyaccjerkmag, tbodygyromag, tbodygyrojerkmag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fbodyacc_{XYZ}, 
fbodyaccjerk_{XYZ}, fbodygyro_{XYZ}, fbodyaccjerkmag, fbodygyromag, fbodygyrojerkmag. 
(Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

Tidy Data Set 
=============

The final tidy data set is called meanstd_by_subject_and_activity
It contains the mean and standard deviation of 33 variables grouped by subject and activity
The final data set has 68 total columns x 180 rows

The 180 rows are as follows:
rows   1:30  = LAYING activity for each of 30 subjects
rows  31:60  = SITTING activity for each of 30 subjects
rows  61:90  = STANDING activity for each of 30 subjects
rows  91:120 = WALKING activity for each of 30 subjects
rows 121:150 = WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS activity for each of 30 subjects
rows 151:180 = WALKING UPSTAIRS activity for each of 30 subjects

The 68 columns are as follows:
Column  1 = Subject (there are 30 total subjects represented by numbers 1:30)
