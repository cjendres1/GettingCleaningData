This CodeBook describes the variables in the tidy data set created with program runAnalysis.R
that is located in this repository.

Feature Selection 
=================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and  
gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. 
These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. 
Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with 
a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated 
into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass 
Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals 
(tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated 
using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, 
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. 
(Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The final tidy data set is called meanstd_by_subject_and_activity
It contains the mean and standard deviation of 33 variables grouped by subject and activity
The final data set has 68 total columns x 180 rows

The 180 rows are as follows:
rows   1:30  = LAYING activity for each of 30 subjects
rows  31:60  = SITTING activity for each of 30 subjects
rows  61:90  = STANDING activity for each of 30 subjects
rows  91:120 = WALKING activity for each of 30 subjects
rows 121:150 = WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS activity for each of 30 subjects
rows 151:180 = WALKING UPSTAIRS activity for each of 30 subjects

The 68 columns are as follows:
Column  1 = Subject (there are 30 total subjects represented by numbers 1:30)
Column  2 = Activity (there are 6 values: 
  LAYING, SITTING, STANDING, WALKING, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, WALKING_UPSTAIRS
Columns 3 - 5  = tbodyacc         MEAN {X,Y,Z}
Columns 6 - 8  = tbodyacc         STD  {X,Y,Z}
Columns 9 -11  = tgravityacc      MEAN {X,Y,Z}
Columns 12-14  = tgravityacc      STD  {X,Y,Z}

Columns 18-20  = tbodyaccjerk     STD  {X,Y,Z}
Columns 21-23  = tbodygyro        MEAN {X,Y,Z}
Columns 24-26  = tbodygyro        STD  {X,Y,Z}
Columns 27-29  = tbodygyrojerk    MEAN {X,Y,Z}
Columns 30-32  = tbodygyrojerk    STD  {X,Y,Z}

Column  36     = tgravityaccmag   STD
Column  37     = tbodyaccjerkmag  MEAN
Column  38     = tbodyaccjerkmag  STD
Column  39     = tbodygyromag     MEAN
Column  40     = tbodygyromag     STD
Column  41     = tbodygyrojerkmag MEAN
Column  42     = tbodygyrojerkmag STD
Columns 43-45  = fbodyacc         MEAN {X,Y,Z}
